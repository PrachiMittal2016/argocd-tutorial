= SyncWaves and Hooks
include::_attributes.adoc[]

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/[Syncwaves,window='_blank'] are used in Argo CD to order how manifests are applied to the cluster. 

On the other hand https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks/[resource hooks,window='_blank'] breaks up the delivery of these manifests in different phases.

Using a combination of syncwaves and resource hooks, you can control how your application rolls out.

This example will take you through the following steps:

* Using Syncwaves to order deployment
* Exploring Resource Hooks
* Using Syncwaves and Hooks together

[#using_syncwaves]
== Using Sync Waves

A Syncwave is a way to order how Argo CD applies the manifests that are stored in git. All manifests have a wave of zero by default, but you can set these by using the `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotation. 

Example:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
----

The wave can also be negative as well.

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "-5"
----

When Argo CD starts a sync action, the manifest get placed in the following order:

* The Phase that they're in (we'll cover phases in the next section)
* The wave the resource is annotated in (starting from the lowest value to the highest)
* By kind (Namspaces first, then services, then deployments, etc ...)
* By name (ascending order)

Read more about syncwaves on the https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/#how-do-i-configure-waves[official documentation site,window='_blank'].

[#exploring_the_manifests]
=== Exploring the Manifests

The sample application that we will deploy has the following manifests:

The *Namespace* with syncwave as *0*:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/overlays/syncwaves/welcome-php-ns.yaml[welcome-php-ns.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$welcome-php-yaml/welcome-php-ns.yaml[]
----

The *Deployment* with syncwave as *1*:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-deployment.yaml[welcome-php-deployment.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$welcome-php-yaml/welcome-php-deployment.yaml[]
----

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====
Minikube::
+
--
The *Service* with syncwave as *2*:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/minikube/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-svc.yaml[welcome-php-svc.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$minikube/welcome-php-yaml/welcome-php-svc.yaml[]
----

The *Ingress* with syncwave as *3*:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/minikube/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-ingress.yaml[welcome-php-ingress.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$minikube/welcome-php-yaml/welcome-php-ingress.yaml[]
----

Add Minikube IP (`minikube ip`) and the Ingress hostname `welcome-php.devnation` to your Host file, like `/etc/hosts`.

Example:
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
192.168.39.242 bgd.devnation bgdx.devnation welcome-php.devnation
----

--
OpenShift::

--
The *Service* with syncwave as *2*:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-svc.yaml[welcome-php-svc.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$welcome-php-yaml/welcome-php-svc.yaml[]
----

The *Route* with syncwave as *3*:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-route.yaml[welcome-php-route.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$welcome-php-yaml/welcome-php-route.yaml[]
----

--
====

Argo CD will apply the Namespace first (since it's the lowest value), and make sure it returns a "healthy" status before moving on.

Next, the Deployment will be applied. After that reports healthy, Argo CD will apply the Service then the Ingress or Route.

NOTE: Argo CD won't apply the next manifest until the previous reports "healthy".

[#deploying_the_application]
=== Deploying the Application

Before we deploy this application, make sure you've opened the Argo CD Web Console.

Access to the Arg2oCD console with the user admin and the password extracted in the previous steps:

image::argocd-login.png[ArgoCDLogin, 600]

Apply the Argo CD `Application` manifest to get this application deployed.

This should create the `welcome-syncwaves` in the ArgoCD UI.

image::welcome-syncwaves.png[Syncwaves1, 400]

Clicking on this "card" will take you to the application overview page. Clicking on "show hidden resources" should expand the "tree" view.

image::welcome-syncwaves-tree.png[Syncwaves2, 400]

If you follow along, you'll note that these manifests get applied in order of their annotated syncwave!

Keep the Argo CD WebUI tab open for the next exercise.


[#exploring_resource_hooks]
== Exploring Resource Hooks

Now that you're familiar with syncwaves, we can begin exploring applying
manifests in phases using `resource hooks`.

Controlling your sync operation can be futher redefined by using
hooks. These hooks can run before, during, and after a sync
operation. These hooks are:

* **PreSync** - Runs before the sync operation. This can be something like a database backup before a schema change
* **Sync** - Runs after `PreSync` has successfully ran. This will run alongside your normal manifesets.
* **PostSync** - Runs after `Sync` has ran successfully. This can be something like a Slack message or an email notification.
* **SyncFail** - Runs if the `Sync` operation as failed. This is also used to send notifications or do other evasive actions.

To enable a sync, annotate the specific object manfiest with
`argocd.argoproj.io/hook` with the type of sync you want to use for that
resource. For example, if I wanted to use the `PreSync` hook:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
----

You can also have the hooks be deleted after a successful/unsuccessful run.

* **HookSucceeded** - The resouce will be deleted after it has succeeded.
* **HookFailed** - The resource will be deleted if it has failed.
* **BeforeHookCreation** - The resource will be deleted before a new one is created (when a new sync is triggered).

You can apply these with the `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy`
annotation. For example

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded
----

> **NOTE** Since a sync can fail in any phase, you can come to a situation where the application never reports healthy!

Although hooks can be any resource, they are usually Pods and/or Jobs.

To read more about resource hooks, consult the https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks[official documentation]

[#exploring_the_manifests_hooks]
=== Exploring Manifests

Take a look at this `PreSync` manifest:

.link:https://github.com/redhat-scholars/argocd-tutorial/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/syncwaves-hooks/hooks/welcome-php-presync-job.yaml[welcome-php-presync-job.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: welcome-presyncjob
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync <1>
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - /bin/bash
        - -c
        - |
          sleep 15
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: welcome-sleep-job
      restartPolicy: Never
----

<1> This means that this Job will run in the `PreSync` phase, before
the application of the manifests in the `Sync` phase.

> **NOTE** Since I don't have a deletion policy, this job will "stick around" after completion.

[#deploying_the_application_hooks]
=== Deploying The Application

This sample will be using `kustomize` to create a new application based
on the one we previously deployed; while adding the `Job`
with the resource hook. You can see this by https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/tree/main/apps/welcome-php/overlays/hooks[visiting the repo,window='_blank'].

Taking a look at this manifest file: `welcome-hooks.yaml`:

On the Argo CD WebUI, you should see another application appear.

image::hooks-card.png[Hooks Card]

Clicking on this "card" should take you over to the tree view.

image::hooks-tree.png[Hooks Tree]

Observe the sync process. You will see that the `PreSync` manifest has
an anchor icon ⚓ . You will also notice that the other manifests don't
start applying until the `PreSync` Job is done.

Once the application is fully synced. Take a look at the pods and jobs in
the namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl get pods,jobs -n welcome-hooks
----

You should see that the Job is finished, but still there.

[.console-output]

Keep this tab open, in the next exercise. We will see how to use Syncwaves
and Hooks in tandem!

[#using_syncwaves_and_hooks]
== Using Sync Waves and Hooks

Now that you got your hands on syncwaves and resource hooks, you will
now use them together to see how you can control how your deployment
rolls out.

In the previous sections you learned how to order the application
of manifests using syncwaves. You also went over how you phase your
deployments with resource hooks.


In this section we will use syncwaves within each phase to show how you
can further refine the deployment process.

Take a look at the following diagram.

image::resource-hooks.png[Resource waves hooks]

The workflow can be summarized like this:

* The `PreSync` phase will run and manifests will be applied in their syncwave order.
* Once the `PreSync` phase is successful, the `Sync` phase begins.
* The `Sync` phase will apply the manifests in the their syncwave order
* Finally, after the `Sync` phase is done, the `PostSync` phase applies the manifests in the syncwave order.

[#exploring_manifests_resources]
=== Exploring Manifests

Here we are adding 3 addition manifests.

A *PreSync* Job with a syncwave of *0*:

.link:[welcome-php-presync-job.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$syncwaves-hooks/syncwaves-and-hooks/welcome-php-presync-job.yaml[]
----

A *PreSync* Job with a syncwave of *1* and a hook deletion policy:

.link:[welcome-php-presync-pod.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$syncwaves-hooks/syncwaves-and-hooks/welcome-php-presync-pod.yaml[]
----

A *PostSync* Pod with a hook deletion policy:

.link:[welcome-php-postsync-pod.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$syncwaves-hooks/syncwaves-and-hooks/welcome-php-postsync-pod.yaml[]
----

The manifest will apply in the following order.

* `PreSync` - The Job will start and finish. The the Pod will start and finish. Once these are both done successfully the `PreSync` phase is considered "done".
* `Sync` - All the manifests will apply in their respective syncwave order. Once this is done successfully, the `Sync` phase is considered done.
* `PostSync` - The Pod will start and finish. Once it's successfully finished, the resource is deleted.

Here you can observe the sync process happening in the order
specified. You will also note that the `PreSync` Pod and the `PostSync`
pod were deleted after the sync process because of the deletion policy
annotation.
