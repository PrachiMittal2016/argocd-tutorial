== SyncWaves and Hooks

This scenario will get you get familiar with syncwaves and hook phases.

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/[Syncwaves] are used in Argo CD to order how manifests are applied to the cluster. 

On the other hand https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/resource_hooks/[resource hooks] breaks up the delivery of these manifests in different phases.

Using a combination of syncwaves and resource hooks, you can control how your application rolls out.

This example will take you through the following steps:

* Using Syncwaves to order deployment
* Exploring Resource Hooks
* Using Syncwaves and Hooks together

== Using Sync Waves

A Syncwave is a way to order how Argo CD applies the manifests that are stored in git. All manifests have a wave of zero by default, but you can set these by using the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave annotation. 

Example:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
----

The wave can also be negative as well.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "-5"
----

When Argo CD starts a sync action, the manifest get placed in the following order:

* The Phase that they're in (we'll cover phases in the next section)
* The wave the resource is annotated in (starting from the lowest value to the highest)
* By kind (Namspaces first, then services, then deployments, etc ...)
* By name (ascending order)

Read more about syncwaves on the https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/#how-do-i-configure-waves[official documentation site].

=== Exploring the manifests

The sample application that we will deploy has the following manifests:

* The https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/overlays/syncwaves/welcome-php-ns.yaml[Namespace] with syncwave as 0
* The https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-deployment.yaml[Deployment] with syncwave as 1
* The https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-svc.yaml[Service] with syncwave as 2 
* Finally the https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/openshift-gitops-examples/blob/main/apps/welcome-php/base/welcome-php-route.yaml[Route] with syncwave as 3

Argo CD will apply the Namespace first (since it's the lowest value), and make sure it returns a "healthy" status before moving on.

Next, the Deployment will be applied. After that reports healthy, Argo CD will apply the Service then the Route.

NOTE: Argo CD won't apply the next manifest until the previous reports "healthy".

=== Deploying The Application

Before we deploy this application, make sure you've opened the Argo CD Web Console.

Access to the ArgoCD console with the user admin and the password extracted in the previous steps:

Apply the Argo CD `Application` manifest to get this application deployed.

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====
Minikube::

--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
#!/bin/bash
kubectl apply -f assets/syncwaves-hooks/welcome-syncwaves.yaml
----

--

OpenShift::

--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
#!/bin/bash
oc apply -f assets/syncwaves-hooks/welcome-syncwaves.yaml
----

This should create the `welcome-syncwaves` in the ArgoCD UI.

Clicking on this "card" will take you to the application overview page. Clicking on "show hidden resources" should expand the "tree" view.

If you follow along, you'll note that these manfiests get applied in order of their annotated syncwave!

Keep the Argo CD WebUI tab open for the next exercise.
